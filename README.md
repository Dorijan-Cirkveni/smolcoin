What is Smolcoin?
----------------

Smolcoin is a fork of Bitcoin code as it was on 19/06/2021 with one small adjustment:
The coin supply will be 10^12 times smaller - instead of 21 million coins (21 * 10^6), the maximum supply is 21 millionth OF A COIN (21 * 10^-6).
It's still a work in progress, though - although the code shouldn't be hard to change. I'll just adjust the amount.h file.
